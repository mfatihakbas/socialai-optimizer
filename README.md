# socialai-optimizer
 AI-powered platform for social media content analysis and optimization, designed for camps and event-based organizations.
1. Requirement Analysis
Project Title: AI-Powered Social Media Analytics and Optimization Platform

This project is developed specifically for Clearwater Forest Camp and Retreat. It is a platform that works with Instagram and Facebook to analyze social media content and optimize engagement.
The system offers suggestions for content creation, ideal posting time, and audience interaction using an AI-powered assistant (AI Agent).

The platform is designed with three different user profiles in mind:

Business Owners (camp managers)

Content Creators (social media managers)

Admins (system owner/developer)

While the initial version is tailored for Clearwater Forest, the platform is structured to be scalable for other camps and organizations in the future.
